## Use Guide
- To install the package to default python
```bash
pip install .
```
- Import the library
```python
import polytopewalk
```
- Example
```python
import polytopewalk as pw
# dimension
d = 2
(A, b) = pw.define_polytope(d, rep=0)
# radius 
r = 0.5
nb_samples = 10
nb_iters = 20

# generate samples with vaidya and john walk
samples_vaidya = pw.run_vaidya_walk(nb_samples, nb_iters, A, b, r)
samples_john = pw.run_john_walk(nb_samples, nb_iters, A, b, r)
```
